# FactorioScenarioMultiplayerSpawn
A custom scenario for allowing separate spawn locations in multiplayer. Designed for Co-op and PvE. 

## Read the WIKI
The github wiki page will have the most up to date information. If you have questions, go there first, otherwise just ask.

## Versions
Check releases for stable versions. 0.17 and 0.16 have final stable versions that will no longer be maintained.
The latest master is for 1.0.0+

## Status
At this time I have no more planned features and will only be in support and maintenance mode.

## Credit
Several other portions of the code (tags, frontier style rocket silo) have also been adapted from other scenario code.

Credit to 3Ra for help as well: https://github.com/3RaGaming

Praise be to Mylon

## Random Notes
Feel free to submit bugs/fixes/requests/pulls/forks whatever you want.

I do not plan on supporting PvP, but I will help anyone who wants to make it a configurable option.
