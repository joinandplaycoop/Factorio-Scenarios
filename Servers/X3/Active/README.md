# FactorioScenarioMultiplayerSpawn
A custom scenario for allowing separate spawn locations in multiplayer. Designed for Co-op and PvE.

## Instructions
Download the zip.

Place it in your Factorio/scenarios/... folder

It should look something like this (for my windows steam install location):

C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Factorio\scenarios\jvmguyScenario\control.lua


## Configuration

Look in config.lua for some controls over the different modules.  

Not all configurations have been fully tested so modify at your own risk.


## TODO
Much needed.

## Credit
Very little of this is my own creation. It's my spin on a scenario created by Oarc.
